Design Challenges I Faced:

One of the biggest challenges I faced while working on my repository was that it was my first time developing a fully responsive website — one that works well on both small screens (like phones) and larger desktop screens. Making sure that the layout, text sizes, and elements adjusted properly across different devices required a lot of attention to detail. I had to learn how to use media queries, flexible layouts, and test across various screen sizes, which was challenging but a great learning experience.

Inspiration Behind My Theme and Colors:

For the theme and color palette, I chose a combination of blue and black. I was inspired by how blue often represents trust, calmness, and professionalism, while black adds a modern and sleek feel to the design. I wanted my website to look both clean and professional, and this combination helped me achieve that. While I didn’t have a very specific source of inspiration, I was drawn to this color scheme because of how balanced and visually appealing it is.
